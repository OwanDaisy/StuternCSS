<strong><p>Differences between Paddings, Margins and Borders</p>
</strong>
<p><strong>Margin:</strong> It is the space around an element.
     Margins are used to move an element up or down on a page as well as left or right. 
     Margin is completely transparent, and it does not have any background color. 
     It clears the area around the element. Each side of the element has a margin size you can change individually. 
     In creating the gap, the margin pushes adjacent elements away. <br> <br>

     <strong>Padding:</strong> It is the space between the element and the related content inside it. 
     It determines how elements look and sit within a container. 
     It also shows the container background around the element in it. 
     Padding can be affected by background colors as it clears the area around the content. 
     To create the gap, it either grows the element size or shrinks the content inside. 
     By default, the size of the element increases. <br> <br>

     <strong>Border:</strong> The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored. <br> <br>
     <em>In Other words, while padding is the space between the content and the border, margin is the space outside the border.</em>
